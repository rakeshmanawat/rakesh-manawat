    <h1 class="project-title">Analysis of Traffic Congestion</h1>

    <p class="project-objective">
        <strong>Description:</strong> This project focuses on analyzing traffic congestion patterns,
        identifying peak hours, and estimating average vehicle waiting time. The analysis aims
        to propose improvements for smoother traffic flow and reduced congestion.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">Key Contributions</h3>
    <ul class="project-points">
        <li>Studied traffic flow behavior to identify peak congestion periods.</li>
        <li>Calculated average waiting time for vehicles at high-traffic intersections.</li>
        <li>Used Python for model verification, validation, and in-depth traffic pattern analysis.</li>
        <li>Provided potential solutions for reducing congestion and improving travel efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
